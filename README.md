### Hi there

My name is Hannah and I am a junior in Aerospace Engineering at Iowa State University. 

### A few things about me:

1. I’m currently working on AER E 361 and eventually completing my degree.
2. Some of the other courses I am taking right now are: 351, 311, 344, and 421.
3. I’m currently learning how to use GitHub, Latex, and Markdown while learning how to program in C, MATLAB, and Mathematica.
4. Outside of school my hobbies include skiing, storm chasing, and camping.
5. I am most interested in studying aerodynamics and their applications to both aircraft and wind turbine design.
