### Hi there

My name is Hannah and I am a junior in Aerospace Engineering. 

### A few things about me:

1. I’m currently working on AER E 361 and eventually completing my degree
2. I’m currently learning how to use GitHub, Latex, and Markdown while learning how to program in C, MATLAB, and Mathematica.
3. Outside of school my hobbies include skiing, storm chasing, and camping.
